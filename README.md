# MeteorAdditions
MeteorAdditions is intended to be used with the latest development build of Meteor.\
Sometimes, it might not be updated for new changes instantly, please open an issue if it doesn't work anymore.

## Features
MeteorAdditions provides the following features:
- ModMenu integration for MeteorClient (opens the ClickGUI)
- "Servers" option in the multiplayer menu:
  - Server discovery (discover new servers based on another IP of a hosting provider)
  - Clean up (remove outdated servers or ones that no longer exist)
  - Easy saving/loading of servers between instances
- "Spawn Items" module to create a lot of item entities in creative
- Creative tab with several OP items partially taken from wurst modules (add items using the .save-item command or by editing .minecraft/meteor-client/additions_items.txt)
- AutoSpectre based on [#1932](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client/pull/1932)
- Translator module to configure my [google-chat mod](https://gitlab.com/jfmods/googlechat) (google-chat is included in MeteorAdditions)

[My fork](https://github.com/JFronny/meteor-client) of the Meteor Client contains other features for which meteor code needed to be modified
